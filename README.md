cloud_cost_algorithms
=====================

Algorithms to determine the least expensive resource configurations for executing data-intensive workloads in the Amazon clouds. 

My focus is on the results not the code since results matters the most. Further, I explore different performance and cost models to improve the accuracy of my systems. Therefore, you may see I cut corners in the code with redundancy, inelegance and inconsistency for faster development cycles. 

The results are published in chapter 6 of my PhD thesis [1] (specifically Section 6.3.2). The results have also been submitted for publication at IEEE Transactions journal [2].
