== CloudWlMgmt (Static) ==
- QNM predictions for static cases for both open and closed models
- closed: implemented multi-class, multi-center approx mva -- validated against book examples
- Added more actions: ADD_EXPENSIVE, DOWNGRADE, LOADBALANCE, DOWNSIZE
- SLA & binary penalty model
- validation scenarios
- predictions using luis response time values
- csv: extending, refactoring, abstracting
- plug & play VMs
- bug fixing: algo.

== FGCS ==
- using only greedy and adaptiveGreedy'
- QNM predictions for static cases for closed models
- Revised cost model
- handle case when #classes < #cores on a VM
- fixing bugs

== FractionalWorkloads ==
- defining workloads in terms of fractions
- userload is part of attributes
- added weka based prediction model to give predictions over fractional workloads
- updated cost model to generate prediction over fractional workloads
- inaccurate cost model
